# PLANT WATERING SYSTEM STIMULATION 

### DESCRIPTION
#### Arduino Board: Central unit controlling the system.
#### LCD: Displays temperature, moisture, and humidity data.
#### Moisture Sensor: Measures soil moisture level.
#### Temperature Sensor: Measures ambient temperature.
#### Humidity Sensor: Measures ambient humidity.
#### Water Pump: Controls irrigation.
#### Buzzer: Alerts for various conditions.
## How It Works
#### Initialization: Sets up sensors and actuators; displays a welcome message.
#### Sensor Readings: Reads data from moisture, temperature, humidity, 
#### Display and Serial Output: Shows sensor data on the LCD and serial monitor.
## Control Logic:
#### Turns off the pump if it's HIGH MOISTURE & HUMIDITY.
#### Activates the pump if moisture is low, temperature is high, or humidity is low.
#### Uses LCDs and buzzer for visual and audible alerts.
